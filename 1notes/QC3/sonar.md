sonar


# SONAR

## SONARlint
- SonarLint is free, open source, and available in the Visual Studio, which will help you fix code quality issues before they even exist.

## SONARcloud

>Cloud based code analysis service

- Looks at already existing code base
- Analysis static code, it does not rely on running the code.
- scans are configured to be purposfully conservative to mininmize false positives (flaggin things wrong, when they are OK), so if SONARcloud flags an issue it is probably one that you need to fix

Issus can be
- `code smells`
- bugs
-  `security hotspots`
