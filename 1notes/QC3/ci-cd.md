# CI/CD/CD 

## The difference between CI CD and CD
`Continuous Integration`
- every code commit is built and tested

`Continuous Delivery`
- the application is continuously deployed on the test servers for UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
- the application is ready to be released to production anytime. 

`Continuous Deployment` 
- you are not just creating a deployable package, but you are deploying it in an automated fashion.





## CI (Continuous Integration)
> CI is a software development process where a code is continuously tested.

With continuous integration, bugs can be identified early and fixed before pushing changes to production.

Advantages are:
- Reduced development cycle
- Shorter time to integrate code
- Faster feedback to developer teams
- Automated workflow

## CD (Continuos Deployment)
 >Is a strategy or methodology for software releases where any new code update or change made through the rigorous automated test process is deployed directly into the live production environment, where it will be visible to customers.


Benefits of Continuos Deployemnt
- quick new releases
- rapid feedback loop with customers
