Build jobs are the basics of a Continuous Integration server.
A build job is a particular way of compiling, testing, packaging, deploying with your project.
A software project will usually have several related build jobs.

For example, you might choose to start with a dedicated build job that runs all of your unit tests. If this pass, you might proceed to a building job that executes longer-running integration tests, runs code quality metrics, or generates technical documentation, before finally bundling up your web application and deploying it to a test server.
