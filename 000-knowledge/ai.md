# AI
## Artificial Intelligence
> Technology that simulates human inteeligence: pattern recognition and problem solving

### Weak vs. Strong AI

#### Weak AI
 - focused on a specific task: image recognition, language processing
 - struggle to apply their knowledge and skills to other areas

#### Strong AI
- theoretical technology (we don't have it yet)
- AI with a general knowledge and the ability to adapt and learn

### Generative AI
> AI used to create / genearate new content
- relies on training data to learn patterns to produce new content
- ChatGPT: text, GITHub Copilot: code


## Machine Learning
> Branch of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

### Machine Learning Process
#### 1. Decision Process
The algorithm will attempt to predict a value or classify a new example based on previous information.
#### 2. Error Function
A way to measure how wrong the model is.

#### 3. Model Optimalization Process
Updates the model to achive lower error rates.
- updates the model weights which control how important specific data/inputs are


### Machine Learning Types
- Supervised Learning
    - uses a labeled data set
    - a data set with correct labels attached
- Unsupervised Learning
    - uses unlabeled data set
    - uncovers hidden features of data
- Semi-Supervised Learning
    - often starts with a small labeled dataset
    - combines label and unlabeled data sets

### Machine Learnign Algorithms
- Neural Networks
    - uses a series of nodes called neurons
- Linear Regression
    - supervised learning
    - predict numerical values
    - based on a linear relationship between differen values
- Logistic Regression
    - supervised learning
    - makes predictions for categorical response variables
- Clustering
    - unsupervised learning
    - can identify data that can be groupped
- Decision Trees
    - can be used for prediction of numerical values of categories
    - uses a branching sequence of linked decisions


## LLM (Large Langue Model)
> Type of AI that can recognize and generate text.
- trained on huge datasets
- trained further via tuning 
- ChatGPT is an LLM


## Promt Engineering
> Means prompting the AI system in a way that let's it better comprehend and answer your question.

### How to Prompt Engineer
- provide a  persona


#### n-Shot prompting
- zero shot prompting
    - typical, generic prompting

- few shot prompting
    - provide examples in your prompt
    - let's AI focus
