# GIT

## Issues
- GIT ignores `.gitignore`
    - Suggestion: Make sure your .gitignore file uses ANSI or UTF-8 encoding. If it uses something else like Unicode BOM, it's possible that Git can't read the file. (from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11451535/gitignore-is-ignored-by-git )
    - Recreated `.gitignore` in git bash instead of VSCode terminal and it worked again
