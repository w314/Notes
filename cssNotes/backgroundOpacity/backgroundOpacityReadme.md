# CSS Backgrounds

## Opacity
- Opacity can be set with with the `opacity: 0.5` attribute, with possible values between 1 and 0, where 0 is completely transparent. Setting the trasnparency this way makes the text in the elements hard to read as they inherit the attribute.
- Other way is to set transparency by alpha in rgba like:  `background-color: rgba(23, 176, 35, 0.5)`, where `alpha` sets the transparency, it's value can be between 1 and zero. It is not inherited.
