## Artificial Intelligence
> Technology that simulates human inteeligence: pattern recognition and problem solving

### Weak vs. Strong AI

#### Weak AI
 - focused on a specific task: image recognition, language processing
 - struggle to apply their knowledge and skills to other areas

#### Strong AI
- theoretical technology (we don't have it yet)
- AI with a general knowledge and the ability to adapt and learn

### Generative AI
> AI used to create / genearate new content
- relies on training data to learn patterns to produce new content
- ChatGPT: text, GITHub Copilot: code


## Machine Learning
> Branch of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
